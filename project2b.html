            <h2>What our product is and who I am?</h2>
            <p> I am currently a sports betting analyst for a company named Kitchen Betting where
                we sell our player props and moneylines to people for $20 a month through a payment process
                known as dubclub. This is a really good way for me to make money as a college student working a side job
                while getting a bachelor degree. The main objective of the company is to help guide and teach
                people how to find props with high hit value through research and a data analysis using a
                company known as props.cash. We plan to bring in and engage a community to make more
                positive and successful people while having some fun. We plan to target people who are
                running low on money to make their bankroll bigger and have helped people go on vacation or
                such as buy houses.</p>
                <h2>Customer Reviews</h2>
                <p>"I joined because of a slip I saw on Reddit with some write ups and liked the style and idea behind some props. And a few months later here we are. The methods and research works"
                </p>
                
                <p>"2nd day in the discord, 2nd day cashing. Make sure you get on chalkboard and tail the plays! Quality over quantity, and patience is key!"</p>
